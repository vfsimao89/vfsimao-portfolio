                                        User interviews and usability testing were conducted to gather valuable feedback for iterative design improvements.<br>
                                        To visualize design concepts and gain stakeholder approval, I created wireframes, prototypes, and interactive mockups.<br>

                                        By creating a modern and user-friendly design, we were able to improve the overall brand image.<br>

                                    <h6 data-dsn-animate="up">Situation:</h6>

                                    <p data-dsn-animate="up">TrayCommerce, a well-known e-commerce and retail SaaS platform in the Locaweb Group, 
                                        hired me as a UX/UI Designer.<br>
                                        Hired to improve the design of various marketing assets in order to boost digital marketing efforts.</p><br>

                                    <h6 data-dsn-animate="up">Task:</h6>

                                    <p data-dsn-animate="up">As part of the Digital Marketing Team, I worked closely with the marketing team to create 
                                        visually appealing and effective digital marketing assets.<br>
                                        Designing social media graphics, email marketing templates, landing pages, and other promotional materials was my responsibility.<br>
                                        Created a comprehensive content marketing strategy to engage and educate our target audience.</p><br>

                                    <h6 data-dsn-animate="up">Action:</h6>

                                    <p data-dsn-animate="up">As a UX/UI Designer on the Digital Marketing Team, I created eye-catching and on-brand social 
                                        media designs that increased brand visibility and engagement.<br>
                                        Created responsive and user-friendly email marketing templates that increased click-through and conversion rates.<br>
                                        Created enticing landing pages that were conversion-optimized, resulting in increased lead generation and sales.<br>
                                        Collaborated with content creators to create a content marketing strategy that combines design and content to tell 
                                        compelling stories.</p><br>

                                    <h6 data-dsn-animate="up">Result:</h6>

                                    <p data-dsn-animate="up">TrayCommerce's online presence was enhanced by visually appealing social media designs 
                                        that resulted in more followers and interactions.<br>
                                        Improved email marketing performance metrics significantly, including higher open and click-through rates.<br>
                                        Contributed 40% increase in landing page conversion rates, resulting in increased lead acquisition and revenue growth.<br>
                                        Improved the content marketing strategy's synergy between design and content, resulting in higher reader 
                                        engagement and thought leadership positioning.</p><br>

                                    <h6 data-dsn-animate="up">Take Away:</h6>

                                    <p data-dsn-animate="up">During my two years as a UX/UI Designer on TrayCommerce's Digital Marketing Team, I was instrumental 
                                        in improving the visual identity and effectiveness of our digital marketing efforts.<br>
                                        I helped TrayCommerce grow and gain 
                                        brand recognition by creating engaging social media designs, optimized email marketing templates, and high-converting 
                                        landing pages. Furthermore, my involvement in developing the content marketing strategy improved the visual appeal of 
                                        our content, resulting in increased reader engagement and market authority.</p>
